## Description
The challenge was to build the back end for a e-commerce site. We worked with an Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## User Story
<br>AS A manager at an internet retail company
<br>I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
<br>SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
<br>WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
<br>THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
<br>WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
<br>THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
<br>WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
<br>THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
<br>WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
<br>THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
<br>WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
<br>THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
